The Cryptocurrency menu allows you to discover trending cryptocurrency (<a href="https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/crypto/disc/" target="_blank">disc</a>). Additionally, you can also perform research of a specific coin (<a href="https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/crypto/dd/" target="_blank">dd</a>),
NFT (<a href="https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/crypto/nft/" target="_blank">nft</a>) or most lucrative Defi project
(<a href="https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/crypto/defi/" target="_blank">defi</a>). It does so by handing you tools to (among other things) perform technical analysis (<a href="https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/common/ta/" target="_blank">ta</a>), quantitative analysis (<a href="https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/common/qa/" target="_blank">qa</a>), and give you access to onchain information (<a href="https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/crypto/onchain/" target="_blank">onchain</a>).

### How to use

The Cryptocurrency menu is called upon by typing `crypto` which opens the following menu:

You have the ability to search a coin with `find` based on its name or symbol. An example:

As a result, you can see a list of coins matching your search criteria. Once you identify the coin you are looking for, next step is to `load` it. See the example below:

To view the candle chart for the loaded crypto, you can call `candle`. This will show you the coin's historical prices and volume, as follows:

In case you want to adjust the default period, you can do so by specifying the number of days to go back in time.

You might be wondering, how can I know about all possible options? You can type in `command_name -h` or `load -h` in this case. Here you will find available optional arguments that you can play with.

Lastly, by calling `?` or `help` or `h`, the `crypto` menu will be re-populated. Here you can see that several menus have turned blue, which mean you can enter any of them now. In order to use these menus, you are required to first `load` a coin.

### Examples

When entering the `crypto` menu, you would typically want to load in a coin. Let's go with Ethereum. You can do this by specifying its symbol: `load eth`

![Load ETH](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40023817/175827660-3b106e6e-2638-4536-939e-e38692ec1003.png)

Let's checkout its sentiments from major headlines news by typing: `headlines`

Once you have finished analyzing a specific coin, you would want to get a good understanding of the overall crypto market. To do that, head over to `ov` by typing `../ov`.
