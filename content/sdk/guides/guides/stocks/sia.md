The SIA module provides programmatic access to the commands from within the OpenBB Terminal. Import the OpenBB SDK module, and then access the functions similarly to how the Terminal menus are navigated. The code completion will be activated upon entering `.`, after, `openbb.sia`
​

## How to Use

​
The examples provided below will assume that the following import block is included at the beginning of the Python script or Notebook file:
​

```python
from openbb_terminal.sdk import openbb
```

​
A brief description below highlights the main Functions and Modules available in the SIA SDK

Alteratively you can print the contents of the SIA SDK with:
​

```python
help(openbb.sia)
```

## Examples
