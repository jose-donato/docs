The `OpenBBUserData` folder's default location is the home of the system user account. The location of this folder can be set by the user from the `/settings` menu. This folder is where exported files are saved, it is also where files being imported to the Terminal functions are kept. These include all things user-created:

 - Screener presets
 - Portfolio files
 - Exported files
 - Files to be imported by various functions
 - Styles and themes
 - Preferred data sources
 - Anonymized usage logs
