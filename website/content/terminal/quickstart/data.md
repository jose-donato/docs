The `OpenBBUserData` folder's default location is the home of the system user account. By default this will be the following paths:
- macOS: `Macintosh HD/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/OpenBBUserData`
- Windows: `C:/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/OpenBBUserData`

Within the folder you can find files that you have exported as well as files that you wish to import directly into the OpenBB Terminal. For example, this could be an orderbook which you can store in `OpenBBUserData/portfolio/holdings`.
