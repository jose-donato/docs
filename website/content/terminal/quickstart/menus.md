### Explanation of Menus

Menus, depicted in <b><span style={{color:"#005CA9"}}>Dark Blue</span></b>, take you to a new section of the terminal referred
to as a menu. For example, if you wish to view information about stocks, you can do so by typing `stocks` and pressing `ENTER` (‚èé).
This opens a new menu as depicted below.

Depending on the menu you are in, you are presented with a new set of commands (see <a href="#explanation-of-commands">Explanation of Commands</a>)
and menus you can select. There are interactions in place between each menu. For example, when selecting a company within
the `stocks` menu, the terminal will remember your selection when you visit the `fa` or `options` menu.
See <a href="terminal/stocks" target="_blank">Introduction to Stocks</a> for more information.

**Pro tip:** you can quickly jump between menus by using a forward slash (`/`). For example, if I want to access the options
menu, I can type `/stocks/options` to instantly arrive at this menu. You can do this from any location within the
OpenBB Terminal!
