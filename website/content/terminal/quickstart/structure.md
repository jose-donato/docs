# Structure of Terminal

The OpenBB Terminal is based off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface" target="_blank">Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>
which is installed by default on every computer. By opening the application you have installed via "Accessing the OpenBB Terminal",
you are greeted with the following interface:

The OpenBB Terminal is centered around keyboard input. To navigate and perform analysis you will have to type in the name of the command followed by an `ENTER` (⏎). If you wish to see information about the OpenBB Terminal you can do so by typing `about` and then press `ENTER` (⏎). As you are typing, you will notice that you receive suggestions, by using the `DOWN` (⌄) arrow and pressing `ENTER` (⏎) you can select the command and execute it.

Throughout the entire terminal, the same set of colors are used which all share the same representation. This is structured as follows:

- <b><span style={{color:"#00AAFF"}}>Light Blue</span></b>: represents commands.
- <b><span style={{color:"#005CA9"}}>Dark Blue</span></b>: represents menus, also recognizable by the `>` in front.
- <b><span style={{color:"#EF7D00"}}>Orange</span></b>: represents titles and headers.
- <b><span style={{color:"#FCED00"}}>Yellow</span></b>: represents descriptions of a parameter or variable.
- <b>White</b>: represents text, usually in combination with a description that is in Yellow.
