  Here are the steps to get OpenBBTerminal using the Docker containers that we provide:

Installing Docker and Docker Compose Pulling and running OpenBBTerminal Docker
Container Configuring your X-server to show plots Each of this steps need to be
followed to have a working version of OpenBBTerminal.

We will detail these steps in the rest of this document.

### 1. Installing Docker and Docker Compose

INSTALL DOCKER

Installing Docker Desktop is the easiest way for most people:

It has a Graphical User Interface and comes with Docke Compose in it.

You can find Docker Desktop installation file for your OS here:

Download Docker Desktop

START DOCKER

Once you have Docker installed and running, you can use the following command to
check the state:

docker info It should output a text like this one:

Client: Context: default Debug Mode: false

Server: Containers: 14 Running: 2 Paused: 1 Stopped: 10 ... If you see a message
like the following, it most likely means you need to start Docker.

Open the docker desktop app in this case.

Server: ERROR: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at
unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?

### 2. Pulling and running OpenBBTerminal Docker Container

DOCKER COMPOSE

Here are the commands to use Docker Compose to pull and run the OpenBBTerminal
Docker Container:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/main/docker/docker-compose.yaml
docker compose run poetry
```

The command line with curl is downloading this file : docker-compose.yaml.

The docker-compose.yaml file is a configuration file telling Docker Compose:

where to find OpenBBTerminal Docker Container how to run this container. The
second command runs Docker Compose on the service poetry defined in this
docker-compose.yaml file.

This second command must be run in the same folder in which docker-compose.yaml
file is.

DOCKER

If you don't have Docker Compose you can also use Docker directly to run the
OpenBBTerminal Docker Container.

Here is the commands to run:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/openbb-finance/openbbterminal-poetry:X.Y.Z

docker run -v ~/.openbb_terminal/:/home/python/.openbb_terminal -v ~/OpenBBUserData:/home/python/OpenBBUserData -it --rm ghcr.io/openbb-finance/openbbterminal-poetry:X.Y.Z
```

Be sure to replace X.Y.Z with the version you want to pull and run.

Note for windows:

    Ignore this message if you are using Powershell or a more evolved interpreters.
    If you are using the builtin Windows interpreter.
    Replace `~` by `%USERPROFILE%` in the command above.

### 3. Configuring your X-server to show plots

In order to display plots in the docker container, we need to configure the
XServer on the host machine. Without this configuration the interactive charts
will not be displayed.

On Windows Download and install : VcXsrv

When running the program is important to check "Disable access control"

Run Docker Compose like this:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/main/docker/docker-compose.yaml
docker compose run poetry
```

Or run Docker directly:

```bash
docker run -v ~/.openbb_terminal:/home/python/.openbb_terminal -v ~/OpenBBUserData:/home/python/OpenBBUserData -it --rm --env DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0 ghcr.io/openbb-finance/openbbterminal-poetry:X.Y.Z
```

X-Server on macOS Users familiar with Docker and X-Server can set the DISPLAY
variable in the file setenv described above. If you use this approach remember
to add :0 at the end of your inet address. E.g. DISPLAY=192.168.1.155:0.

For help setting up the X-Server continue reading:

Setting up X Quartz/X11 On macOS the X11 client of choice is XQuartz. On Windows
it's Xming. XQuartz will be used as an example further on.

Install X Quartz from https://www.xquartz.org/ With X Quartz open: go to
Preferences -> Security and make sure both options are enabled.

Adding the display for Docker From the command prompt or terminal, run the
following to add your local configuration to the list of allowed access control:

```bash
IP=$(ifconfig | grep inet | grep -v -e "127.0.0.1" | awk '$1=="inet" {print $2}')
xhost + $IP
```

Now we can run the docker container, adding the display to the environment:

```bash
docker run -v ~/.openbb_terminal/:/home/python/.openbb_terminal -v ~/OpenBBUserData:/home/python/OpenBBUserData -it --rm --env-file=path/to/setenv --env DISPLAY=$IP:0 ghcr.io/openbb-finance/openbbterminal-poetry:X.Y.Z
```

This container will be able to display all the same plots as the terminal
interface.

X-Server on Linux Desktop X-Server is default in Linux distribution. There is no
need to install any clients.

Local docker container We can use IPC socket to connect Desktop.

Add this setting to your .env file.

```bash
OPENBB_BACKEND=Qt5Agg
```

And run the following commands.

```bash
xhost +local:
docker run -it --rm --name openbb --env-file=./.env -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix ghcr.io/openbb-finance/openbbterminal-poetry:X.Y.Z
xhost -local:
```

If you're using remote docker host, you can connect with `ssh -X <FQDN/IP>`.

Then run the previous docker command.

Installing the terminal
These steps are common in all operating systems (Windows with or without WSL, MacOS or Linux).

This project supports Python 3.8 and 3.9. By default, the newly created virtual
environment will use Python 3.9.13

Our current recommendation is to use this project with Anaconda's Python
distribution - either full Anaconda3 Latest or Miniconda3 Latest (recommended).
Several features in this project utilize Machine Learning. Machine Learning
Python dependencies are optional. For MacOS systems, the "Miniconda3 MacOSX
64-bit" version that works on both Intel and M1 macs is recommended.

NOTE: We recommend using conda and poetry because it just works. You can use
other python distributions and use raw pip instead of poetry but you will very
likely bump into installation issues.

Install Anaconda (It's on the AUR as anaconda or miniconda3!)

Follow the instructions specified on the website above:

If you are using macOS click Installing on MacOS If you are using WSL or Linux
click Installing on Linux If you are using Windows click Installing on Windows.
ONLY REQUIRED IF NOT USING WSL, you also need to install/update Microsoft C++
Build Tools from here:
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/ After following the
steps, confirm that you have it by opening a terminal and running: conda -V. The
output should be something along the lines of: conda 4.11.0

### Install git

```bash
conda install -c anaconda git
```

For Linux users only, run these additional commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y cmake gcc
pip install cmake
```

### Clone the Project

Via HTTPS: git clone https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal.git via
SSH: git clone git@github.com:OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal.git Navigate into
the project's folder

```bash
cd OpenBBTerminal/
```

### Create Environment

You can name the environment whatever you want. Although you could use names
such as: welikethestock, thisistheway or diamondhands, we recommend something
simple and intuitive like obb. This is because this name will be used from now
onwards.

Please note, the following setup has been confirmed to work for all OS
(including M1) with the standard miniconda distribution.

https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

If you are using a different distribution, you will need to install it manually
before proceeding.

```bash
conda env create -n obb --file build/conda/conda-3-9-env.yaml
```

Or, to include machine learning type:

```bash
conda env create -n obb --file build/conda/conda-3-9-env-full.yaml
```

_Note: Using python 3.10 can lead to undesirable functionality for certain
commands._

### Activate the virtual environment

```bash
conda activate obb
```

Note: At the end, you can deactivate it with: conda deactivate.

### Install dependencies with poetry

Install the main dependencies with

```bash
poetry install
```

For machine learning instead type:

```bash
poetry install -E prediction
```

If you are having trouble with Poetry (e.g. on a non-conda python), simply
install requirements.txt with pip

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### You're ready to use the terminal!

```bash
python terminal.py
```

If you are using macOS and if you get SyntaxError, you might need to run this
instead

```bash
python3 terminal.py
```

(Windows - Optional and only if you are not using WSL) Speeding up opening
process in the future

After you've installed OpenBB Terminal, you'll find a file named "OpenBB
Terminal.bat". You can use this file to open OpenBB Terminal quicker. This file
can be moved to your desktop if you'd like. If you run into issues while trying
to run the batch file. If you run into issues with the batch files, edit the
file and check to see if the directories match up. This file assumes you used
the default directories when installing.

Jupyter Lab (Optional. Early alpha). User the Terminal from Jupyter Lab

You can install Jupyter Lab extensions that help you manage settings and launch
the terminal in a JL bash console using the commands in the jupyterlab/README.md

NOTE: When you close the terminal and re-open it, the only command you need to
re-call is conda activate gst before you call python terminal.py again.
