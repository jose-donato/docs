# hma

The Hull Moving Average solves the age old dilemma of making a moving average more responsive to current price activity whilst maintaining curve smoothness. In fact the HMA almost eliminates lag altogether and manages to improve smoothing at the same time.

### Usage

```python
usage: hma [-l N_LENGTH] [-o N_OFFSET]
```
