# stoch

The Stochastic Oscillator measures where the close is in relation to the recent trading range. The values range from zero to 100. %D values over 75 indicate an overbought condition; values under 25 indicate an oversold condition. When the Fast %D crosses above the Slow %D, it is a buy signal; when it crosses below, it is a sell signal. The Raw %K is generally considered too erratic to use for crossover signals.

### Usage

```python
usage: stoch [-k N_FASTKPERIOD] [-d N_SLOWDPERIOD] [--slowkperiod N_SLOWKPERIOD]
```
