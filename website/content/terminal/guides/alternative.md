Investors utilize alternative data to analyze a company or investment that is
not available through typical data sources (financial statements, SEC filings,
management presentations, press releases, etc.). Traditional data sources do not
provide investors with as accurate, timely, or granular insights and
measurements into corporate performance as alternative data does. Increases in
computing power and personal device usage have resulted in tremendous data
production during the previous ten years. As a result, a slew of new businesses
have sprung up to collect, clean, analyze, and interpret data in order to sell
it as a product that might help investors make better decisions.
