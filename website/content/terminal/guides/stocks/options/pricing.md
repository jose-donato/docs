excerpt: "This guide introduces the user to the Options Pricing submenu, within the Options menu."

This set of features is for composing hypothetical outcomes through user-defined inputs. There are two columns of inputs: the price for the underlying at the close on expiration and the statistical probability of the outcome.

The Pricing submenu is accessible after selecting an<a href="/terminal/reference/stocks/options/exp" target="_blank">expiration</a> date for the options chain. Type, `pricing`, and press enter for access.

### How to use

Use the `add` command to build the list, and use the `rmv` command to take away any entries.

`show` will print a table of the inputs. Multiple price points can be added, assuming that probability always sums at 100%.

<h2>Examples</h2>

Adding the optional argument, `-p`, will calculate the puts in the chain.

Removing the risk-free rate variable makes a substantial difference to the calculated value of an option.
