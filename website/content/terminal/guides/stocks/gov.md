The features in this menu are intended to show the reported trades of elected officials, lobbyist activity, awarded contracts, and general spending of the United States Treasury Department. This menu only covers the USA, or companies that trade on US exchanges. The information in this menu is compiled by <a href="https://quiverquant.com" target="_blank">QuiverQuant</a>.

A ticker is not required to enter the menu; navigate there from anywhere in the terminal with absolute path jumping: `/stocks/gov`

<h2>How to use the Government Menu</h2>

The menu is divided into two sections. Features under the `Explore:` do not depend on individual tickers, while the commands listed under `Ticker:` do. Entering `lasttrades` will return a table with the five most recent days of reported trades made by Congress members.

`lasttrades senate` & `lasttrades house` will other elected officials.

`toplobbying` brings up a bar graph of recent big spenders on K Street, that are listed on-exchange. The optional arguments `l`, `--raw` & `--export` changes the number of companies returned, shows a table of the raw data, or exports the data to a file.

The trivial spending by government can be tracked with the command, `lastcontracts`. Screwdrivers, furniture, bath towels; keep tabs on where those tax dollars are spent.

`load` a specific ticker to activate the lower features.

<h2>Examples</h2>

Microsoft is a favourite in Washington; `gtrades` shows the bullish or bearish tendencies of elected officials over time.

A table of this chart, with representatives' names, is called by adding the `--raw` flag to the command string.
