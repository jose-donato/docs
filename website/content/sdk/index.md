# Introduction

OpenBB SDK gives you direct and programmatic access to all capabilities from
OpenBB Terminal. You will have the necessary building blocks to create your own
financial tools and applications, whether that be a visualization dashboard or a
custom report on Jupyter Notebook.

With OpenBB SDK, you can gain access to normalized financial data from dozens of
data providers, without having to develop your own integrations from scratch. On
top of financial data feeds, OpenBB SDK also provides you with a toolbox to
perform financial analysis on a variety of asset classes, including stocks,
crypto, ETFs, funds, and the economy as well as portfolio optimization and
analysis.

OpenBB SDK is created and maintained by the OpenBB team together with the
contributions from hundreds of community members. This gives us an unrivaled
speed of development and the ability to maintain stable integrations with
numerous third-party data providers. Developing and maintaining a full-blown
investment research infrastructure from the ground up takes a lot of time and
effort. However, it does not have to be this way. By taking advantage of OpenBB
SDK with its out-of-the-box data connectors and financial analysis toolkit, now
you can focus on designing and building your financial reports and applications.
