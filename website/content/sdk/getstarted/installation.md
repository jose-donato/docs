We provide a simple installation method in order to utilize the OpenBB SDK. You must first create an environment,
which allows you to isolate the SDK from the rest of your system. It is our recommendation that you utilize a
`conda` environment because there are optional features, such as `forecast`, that utilize libraries that are
specifically sourced from `conda-forge`. Due to this, if you do not use a conda environment, you will not be
able to use some of these features. As such, the installation steps will be written under the assumption that
you are using conda.

## Steps

### 1. **Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)**

   Download the `x86_64` Miniconda for your respective system and follow along
   with it's installation instructions. The Miniconda architecture MUST be
   `x86_64` in order to use certain features.

### 2. **Create the virtual environment**

```bash
conda create -n obb python=3.9.6 -y
```

### 3. **Activate the virtual environment**

```bash
conda activate obb
```

### 4. **Install OpenBB SDK Core package**

```bash
pip install openbbterminal
```

### 5. **(Optional) Install the Toolkits**

#### 5.1 **If you would like to use the Portfolio Optimization features**

On Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2) install dependency from conda-forge

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge cvxpy=1.2.2 -y
```

And install the Portfolio Optimization Toolkit

```bash
pip install "openbbterminal[optimization]"
```

#### 5.2 **If you would like ML Forecasting features**

On Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2) install dependency from conda-forge

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge lightgbm=3.3.3 -y
```

And install the Forecasting Toolkit

```bash
pip install "openbbterminal[prediction]"
```

#### 5.3 **If you would like to use both Portfolio Optimization and ML forecast features**

On Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2) install dependencies from conda-forge

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge lightgbm=3.3.3 cvxpy=1.2.2 -y
```

And install the Both Toolkits

```bash
pip install "openbbterminal[all]"
```

Congratulations! You have successfully installed `openbbterminal` on an environment and are now able to begin using it. However, it is important to note that if you close out of your CLI you must re-activate your environment in order begin using it again.
